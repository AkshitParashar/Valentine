        <h1>Dear Aishwarya ❤️,</h1>
        <p>Hey Cutie, how are you ? Never did this before so I have no Idea what to right in a letter to you loved one. But I can say, I remember the first time I saw you,
           You were playing basketball and I saw you through my window, and my exact words were "Damn, she is beautiful". Then finally talking to your for the first time,
           when we had that breakfast event in Common Room. I remember each and every moment I spent with you. And I don't know why, thinking about times I spent with you
           makes me smile everytime. You know when we kissed for the first time, I can never describe that feeling, it was just beautiful I can say. With you I stay the 
           happiest person alive, and it's not something you do but your presence is enough to bring warmth, support and care in my life.
           <br>
           I feel lucky enough that our paths crossed, I finally knew how it feels to be with an amazing person. I went to multiple places with swapnil and others but
           everything I try to remember places I visit or felt happy are the ones we went together. My highlight of all the trips would be the time we visited Birmigham and 
           Nottingham. Always stay smiling babe, I like your smile a lot. Hoping, If I got a chance I would Keep you smile intact on your face.
           <br>
           You favourite Quote "All we have is now", If all I have is now then I want time to stop ticking so that I can spend as much time as I can. I know things are going rough
           and I don't know what lies in future, but I know one thing for sure that I'll regret every single of my life if I don't express my feelings for you. I want to be your man
           but I don't know what will happen next. But even if our luck separate our ways, I will always be the guy you remember as "He loved me more than anyone else". May sound bold
           even I am suprised. Uff... I wrote too much didn't I? 
           <br>
           I'll keep working and thriving hard because nothing excites me more than being the guy for you. Stay Happy and Stay Blessed cutie. You may turn 60 but you'll still be
           my cutie pie and I promise you that.

        </p>
        <p>Yours Truly</p>
        <p>Akshit ❤️ <br> <br> P.S: I love you ❤️</p>
